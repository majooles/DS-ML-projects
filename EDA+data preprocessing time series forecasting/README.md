# Retail Sales Prediction Project Overview

My aim is to predict retail sales using various machine learning techniques. I preprocess the data, handle missing values, and analyze different factors influencing sales.


## Data Preprocessing

I begin by loading multiple CSV files containing data on sales, stores, transactions, oil prices, and holiday events. I convert date strings into datetime objects and handle missing values appropriately.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

I explore various aspects of the data, including sales trends over time, transaction patterns, store types, oil prices' influence, and holiday effects on sales.

## Data Merging

I merge the datasets on common columns like 'store_nbr' and 'date' to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis and modeling.

## Feature Engineering

I engineer new features and encode categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding to prepare the data for modeling.

## Feature Scaling

I scale numerical features like sales, transactions, and oil prices using StandardScaler to bring them to a similar scale.

## Model Training

Modeling is not explicitly included in the project overview because the primary focus is on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering.

This project aims only to provide insights into retail sales patterns and develop predictive models to assist in sales forecasting.
